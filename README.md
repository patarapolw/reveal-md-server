## Running a local server

There will be more options to customize, including "running local files", "overriding" and "shuffle"

---

Overriding the local file by creating an `.env` file containing,

```dotenv
FILENAME=<PATH_TO_FILENAME>
```

---

Overriding the YAML front matter by creating `reveal.config.json` containing the [config](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/#configuration). In addition, `theme` and `highlightTheme` can also be edited.

---

Shuffle the slides by adding this to `reveal.config.json`

```json
{
    "shuffle": true
}
```
